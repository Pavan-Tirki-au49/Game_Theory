\# Game Theory Based Strategy Prediction System



\- Overview

This project implements a Game Theory based decision-making system integrated with Machine Learning (SVM) to predict optimal strategies in a competitive business environment. The system analyzes supplier behavior and payoff outcomes to recommend pure or mixed strategies.



The application is built using Python and Streamlit, with database support for storing game data and predictions.

\## Objectives

\- Apply game theory concepts to real-world decision-making problems

\- Predict optimal strategies using pure and mixed strategy models

\- Use Support Vector Machine (SVM) for strategy classification

\- Provide an interactive user interface using Streamlit

\- Store and manage game data using SQLite

\## Technologies Used

\- Python

\- Streamlit

\- Game Theory (Pure and Mixed Strategies)

\- Support Vector Machine (SVM)

\- SQLite Database

\- Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn





\- System Architecture

1\. User inputs game parameters through the Streamlit UI  

2\. Payoff matrices are generated  

3\. Game theory logic computes pure or mixed strategies  

4\. SVM classifies strategy outcomes  

5\. Results are stored and displayed to the user
