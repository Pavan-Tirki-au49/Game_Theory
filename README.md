**About the Project**
**Game Theory Based Strategy Prediction System**

This project is a decision-support system that combines Game Theory and Machine Learning (Support Vector Machine – SVM) to predict optimal strategies in a competitive business environment.

The system models real-world supplier–buyer interactions as a two-player game, where each player’s outcome depends on the strategies chosen by both sides. Traditional game theory techniques such as pure strategy and mixed strategy analysis are used to compute optimal decisions based on payoff matrices. To enhance decision-making, an SVM classifier is integrated to learn from historical data and predict strategy outcomes more accurately.

The application is implemented using Python and provides an interactive Streamlit-based user interface. Users can input game parameters, generate payoff matrices, analyze strategies, and view predictions in real time. The system also uses SQLite databases to store game data, predictions, and historical results for future analysis.

This project demonstrates how theoretical concepts from game theory can be combined with data-driven machine learning techniques to build intelligent and practical decision-making systems.

**What the Project Does**
